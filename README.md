# i get to know more about aws that
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud computing platform that provides on-demand access to computing resources like servers, storage, databases, and software over the internet, instead of buying and maintaining physical hardware.
core Ideas of AWS
Cloud Computing
Instead of running apps on your own computer/server, you use AWS’s infrastructure.
Pay only for what you use (pay-as-you-go model).
Global Infrastructure
Availability Zones (AZs): Multiple data centers in each region for redundancy.
This setup ensures speed, scalability, and reliability.
Main AWS Services (the basics everyone should know):
Compute → EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): virtual servers.
Storage → S3 (Simple Storage Service): object storage for files/data.
Databases → RDS (Relational Database Service), DynamoDB (NoSQL).
Networking → VPC (Virtual Private Cloud), Load Balancers, Route 53 (DNS).
IAM (Identity and Access Management) → controls who can access what.
Service Categories
Billing & Pricing
Pay-as-you-go.
Free tier (first 12 months) for experimenting.
You get billed for usage of compute hours, storage space, data transfer, etc.
Security
Shared Responsibility Model:
AWS secures the cloud infrastructure.
You secure what’s inside your account (apps, data, permissions).
# i get to know the  importance of AWS comes from the role it plays in today’s technology, business, and even government operations.
Global Reach & Availability
AWS has data centers all over the world (Regions + Availability Zones).
This lets companies deploy apps close to their users, improving speed and reliability.
 Scalability & Flexibility
Businesses can start small and scale up or down instantly.
Example: An e-commerce store can handle holiday traffic spikes without buying new servers.
 Cost-Effectiveness
No need for heavy upfront investment in hardware.
Pay only for what you use (storage, compute, bandwidth).
Offers free tier for beginners and startups.
 Security
AWS invests heavily in world-class security (data encryption, compliance certifications).
Governments, banks, and the military use AWS.
With IAM, you can tightly control access.
Wide Range of Services
Over 200 services covering:
